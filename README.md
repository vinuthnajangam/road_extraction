# road_extraction
This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for extracting accurate road networks from high-resolution satellite imagery. It uses a U-Net deep learning model (with a ResNet-34 encoder) to segment road pixels from the background, followed by image processing and graph algorithms to refine and vectorize the detected roads.
